# go-pico

This repository contains a tinygo implementation of the  Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) Microcontroller
and everything else you need in order to start developing golang on the 
RP2040  with [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/). The support for some SDK features are missing on tinygo,
so this is an alternative.

For dependencies and installation, please see [INSTALLATION.md](doc/INSTALLATION.md).
